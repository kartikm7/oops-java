|Encapsulation | Abstraction |
|--|--|
| Encapsulation is wrapping up of data types and methods in a single unit in the case of OOPS in classes.  | Abstraction on the other hand is hiding of the implementation/unnecessary details from the outside world and only exposing the usage/functionality.|
|Encapsulation works on an **implementation level**| Abstraction works on the **design level**.<br/><br/> |
|Focuses on an **internal** outlook|Focuses on an **external** outlook|
|We use **getters** and **setters** to implement encapsulation|We use **abstract classes** and **interfaces** to implement abstraction.|

Encapuslation and Abstraction are usually compared, but in reality they are two pillars/processes of Object Oriented Programming (OOPS) that go **hand-in-hand**.

Because, it most cases it's important to encapsulate a process to abstract it's working from the user.

We really, are surrounded by encapsulation and abstract already even at the base level of a language like Java there  are so many abstractions and encapsulations of workings that we might not comprehend during day to day usage of the language. But, it's super interesting to dive deep into why sometimes. Although this journey of why is also a double edged sword and if not kept in check can deviate you from your goals.
