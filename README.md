# Object Oriented Programming in Java
---
This repository just contains snippets about my journey of learning Java and OOP's.

It's something that's I've really started to enjoy. Honestly, the documentation part of anything I do is something I really enjoy aswell.

I feel vulnerable even putting something like this out. I've written some decent examples, and it might help others aswell. So, here I am on my vulnerable journey of open-source. Honestly, open-source is one of the most beautiful things out there the idea that people put out the source code of things they have written, allow others to use it and contribute is so special. I am just trying to share my journey aswell.

Hope this helps!

Happy coding,
Kartikeya Mishra.
